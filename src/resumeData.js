      p1title: "About the Program",
      p1description:"In this program, I traveled to South Africa and visited many centers for both rehabilitation and homes. We traveled through urban and rural areas, seeing the differences and similarities in barriers that both caregivers and people with disabilities faced. Cities we stayed in were Cape Town, Wooster, and Hobeni.",

      p2title:"Physical Barriers",
      p2description:"Having a physical disability exposes problematic aspects of built environments. These barriers may have been previously invisible to the person if they had no disability before. One of the rehabilitation centers we visited had a course where they would help train people in wheelchairs how to navigate built environments often found in the city. This included stairs, an arching bridge, and uneven sidewalks. However, this creates opportunities to uncover ways we can reduce the amount of physical barriers in built environments to improve accessibility. The scope of “physical barriers” extends beyond a person’s physical ability. It includes compounded disparities, multiple barriers stacked against a person which makes a total problem worse than the sum of its parts. A compounded disparity example is that if someone were low-income, their home would probably be in a part of the city less developed. For example, there were huge townships around Cape Town. The townships are unpaved, and do not always have indoor plumbing, so people have to go outside to the community outhouses. We saw pictures of how tiny these outhouses were, making them inaccessible to people in wheelchairs. If these people were not low-income, and lived in a more developed area, this is not something they would have to deal with. Learning this showed me that accessibility extends beyond the physical disabilities of a person, to a matrix of disabilities, assistive devices, and built environments.",
      p3title:"Lack of Access to Technology",
      p3description:"Technology exists even in rural parts of South Africa where I visited. People had smartphones and Facebook accounts. However, a statistic from Shonaquip says that on average it takes 3 years for a person in South Africa to get a wheelchair after being added to a government wait list. At the end of the study abroad trip, one of the students injured herself and she was able to go to a hospital and buy a wheelchair. This shows that the technology and the devices are there, yet they are still inaccessible to a large segment of the population. Realizing that accessible technology is not always accessible to the user community that needs it had a huge impact on my career outlook as a user centered designer. Thinking with the mindset of inclusive design is important, but being aware of the limitations people may face when trying to access basic assistive technology is also something I need to consider.",
